    <h1>Explain ECMA in JS.</h1>
    <p>
      JavaScript is a superset of ECMAScript. JavaScript is basically ECMAScript
      at its core but builds upon it. Languages such as ActionScript,
      JavaScript, JScript all use ECMAScript as its core. As a comparison,
      AS/JS/JScript are 3 different cars, but they all use the same engine...
      each of their exteriors is different though, and there have been several
      modifications done to each to make it unique.

    <h1>What is JavaScript? And also Explain the history of JavaScript?</h1>
    <p>JavaScript is a scripting or programming language that allows us to implement complex features on web pages. JavaScript is a lightweight, cross-platform, single-threaded, and interpreted compiled programming language. It is also known as the scripting language for webpages.</p>
    <p style="color:blue">History of JavaScript:</p>
    <p>JavaScript was invented by Brendan Eich in 1995. It was developed for Netscape 2, and became the ECMA-262 standard in 1997. Initially called Mocha, then LiveScript, it finally became known as JavaScript. It was designed for the client-side of websites to add dynamic and interactive elements to static HTML pages.
